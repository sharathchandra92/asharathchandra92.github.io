My research focuses on modelling the influence of human factors, such as personality and culture, on users' experience of affect, perception of quality and enjoyment in multimedia. \r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nE-Mail: [sharathc001@e.ntu.edu.sg](mailto:sharathc001@e.ntu.edu.sg)   \r\nLinkedIn: [sharathchandra92](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sharathchandra92)    \r\nResearchGate: [profile](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sharath_Chandra_Guntuku)   \r\nInstagram: [sharathchandra92](http://instagram.com/sharathchandra92/)  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Education and Experience \r\n+ Research Intern, Panasonic R&D, Jan 2016 - Current   \r\n    Deep Learning Framework for Facial Action Unit Recognition   \r\n+ PhD Student, NTU Singapore, Aug 2013 - Current   \r\n    Modeling the Influence of Personality on Users' Response to Multimedia \r\n+ B.E.

Most of the traditional systems, however, only consider the semantics associated with the content, and ignore the influence of human factors on QoE. While it might be acceptable for objective tasks like naming objects or colors etc., present in the content, ignoring human factors might lead to serious issues in subjective tasks like modeling perception of quality, experience of emotion, concepts users ‘like’ etc. This is especially so in tasks where users’ innate psychology is shown to play a significant role in their perception.  Moreover, the challenge in building personalized systems is that users’ profiles (e.g. personality, culture etc.,) are not available freely, and often they need to be collected using survey questionnaires and other intrusive techniques. Therefore, we first attempt to automatically predict users’ personality based on their social media data and then investigate their influence on multimedia perception (specifically perception of quality and experience of affect and enjoyment).   \r\n[Slides](https://www.dropbox.com/s/go6a0qdh4298c7c/PPT_Year2Progress_GSC.pdf?dl=0) *Not Updated.

Then a model is learnt on a collection of images 'liked' by users (from Flickr), and is shown to better state-of-art by 15-20%. Beyond this test-set performance, an attempt is made to qualitatively understand the representations learned by the deep architecture used to model user `likes'.   \r\n[ACCV '14](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cjjxt1cqw7wdqtk/ACCV2014.pdf?dl=1)     \r\n[TIP preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/xdx9p9ngrhayexs/TIP_Submission_R2.pdf?dl=1)   \r\n\r\n+ ***Who Likes What, and Why?* Modeling Users Personality based on Image Likes**   \r\nComputational models show that concepts such as scenes, colors, presence of people has a positive influence on users with high scores on Openness trai. It was observed that extroverted users liked the images with the opposite sex in them and especially those with groups of people. Neurotic users were seen to like cluttered  and surreal images. The features proposed in this work to model users personality based on images they like led to a 12% improvement over the state-of-the-art.     \r\n[TAFFC preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/nk1eunrmiqv8t9t/R2.pdf?dl=1)\r\n\r\n+ **Modeling Users Personality based on Selfies**   \r\nAs another medium of modeling users’ personality, several mid-level cues (such as presence of duck faces, pressed lips etc.) were proposed to be computationally detected on their selfies using traditional visual features (like LBP, BoVW etc). These mid-level cues were then used as predictors to model users’ personality. In contrast to a previous psychology finding, where extraversion was related to positive emotional expression, our study showed that it was not significantly correlated to any cue. One reason could be that users, irrespective of their degree of extraversion, tend to show positive emotion in selfies to maintain positive self-impression. Agreeableness was negatively correlated with camera height indicating that users with high score on agreeableness tend to take selfies from below. Conscientiousness was negatively correlated with private location indicating that conscientious people do not like to expose their private space in the background as corroborated by psychology findings.Neuroticism positively correlated with duckface and many other insights were found on the selfie taking behaviors and how they can be used to model users’ personality.     \r\n[ACM Multimedia '15 ASM Workshop](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5dm5bqbtss60ios/ACM_MM_ASM_2015.pdf?dl=1)\r\n\r\n### Modeling Influence of Personality on Experience of Affect, Perception of Quality and Enjoyment in Multimedia   \r\nAfter training the models to automatically predict users personality, we then investigated the influence of personality on users perception of quality and experience of affect. Computational modeling showed that the inclusion of human factors on top of system factors resulted in a significant relative improvement of 5.6% in positive affect, 13.6% in negative affect and 9.3% in perceived quality for the variance . Apart from bolstering an existing evidence that most users enjoy positive emotions, our study also revealed that certain users (possibly with high scores on neuroticism) tend to enjoy negative emotions like sadness, shame etc. In addition, it was seen that when viewing gory contents like violence, users tended to rate videos with both high and low quality parameters (frame-rate, resolution and bit-rate) equivalently on enjoyment levels. However when it was more acceptable contents such as romance etc., users prefer to have the content delivered at high quality parameters - this implies that content providers can optimize their bandwidth allocation based on both users’ human factors and the content.     \r\n[ACM Multimedia '15 Full Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3n52o4gcyjswtg0/ACM_MM_2015.pdf?dl=1)    \r\n[Transactions preprint](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m8l13n35umpchq2/bare_jrnl.pdf?dl=1)  ",
